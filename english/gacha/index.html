		<h1>Gacha games are a waste of time and you shoundn't be playing them</h1>
		<p>Let's start by the beginning. The beautiful Youtube algorithm recommended me a video called <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPtMpq8c0oQ">"Genshin Impact and the prejudice of those types of games"</a><br>
		, and I highly disagree with the creator's opinion, because, <i>they induce players to spend money of play the game for many hours.</i>
		<br>
		<br>
		Games of this style tend to make use of monetizations, like, lootboxes or skins, because, normally, it's the only way to get money in a free-to-play game.<br>
		(You can also get informations of individuals in the background but, but, shh, no one read that).<br>
		And the problem isn't even monetizing the game like a stupid casino, it's <b>MAKING THIS AN GAME FOR 14+ TO PLAY.</b><br>
		<br>

		<p>The creators get money at tge expense of teenagers that don't have their brain fully developed and<br>
		think it's a good idea to trow away like 200, 300 or even a thousand dolars to get a character in a game.</p>
		<p>and, even if you don't spend a penny, it will make you do grinding, and it may lead to people think the game is like a type of"work",<br>
		this corrodes to them to a point that they don't enjoy live and just play X game like Genshin Impact.</p>
		<p>In a way or another, they will leave with some kind of loss, being it material or psycological. Because of that, I don't recommend anyone to play this type of game.</p>
